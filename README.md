OCHA Colombia
=============
Script to transform the OCHA Colombia databae into the HDX format (CPS). It loads a database with 1,276,335 values, transforms the entities and timespans of the observations into those accepted by CPS.

The file `value.csv` is too big for GitHub (400 + mb). Hence, the folder data/cps/ contains only a sample of that file. The CPS-ready package can be found on HDX' Repository at: http://test-data.hdx.rwlabs.org/dataset/raw-ocha-colombia-sidih
